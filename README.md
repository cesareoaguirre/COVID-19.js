# COVID-19.js
A COVID-19 database engine with a json source. Now it provides Infection occourrences in a period of time. All countries up to march 18 by now. 

In a near future It will support number of deceases, recovered and suspected cases and a query by date and country (now it creates all objects).



*** It will be good if you install LibreOffice and Excel to Json (You may not need LibreOffice Microsoft Excel it's installed on your system)

In terminal, execute:
> libreoffice --convert-to xlsx timeline-full.ods && excel2json-3 --file timeline-full.xlsx

What to to do, then? go to covid-19.js and explore.
